    /*
       COMPLEXITY DISCUSSION

      Given:
              U = List of positive integers
              n = number of elements in U
              k = number of subsets
              t = number of iteration
              m = average number of elements per subset

      The Grasp Complexity:  The initialization of the new unallocated list and the priority queue are both O(n) &
      O(k) respectively. The while loop that loops through the elements in the unallocated list which means it loops n
      times, inside the loop the top 3 elements is picked and one is randomly selected, this operation of selecting one
      occurs in constant time O(1). However the processing of updating the priority queue which involves reordering the
      queue has a complexity of O(log k), which makes the complexity of the GRASP to be O(n log k)



  3a) The optimisation version of the multi-way partitioning problem

      ## TIME COMPLEXITY
      There are 2 main operations, the Partitioning using GRASP, and Calculating the subset sum differences.
      The process of calculating the subset sum difference can be evaluated as :
      sum for one subset will be O(m), and for all subsets, it is O(mk). However, m can be expressed
      as n/k and thus this becomes O(n), comparing this complexity to that of the GRASP, it is obvious that the GRASP
      dominates. which makes the overall complexity O(t * n log k) and based on the implementation in this code,
      the worst case is O(10,000 * n log k) because t = 10,000.

      ## SPACE COMPLEXITY
      The list U which contains n elements requires O(n) space, additionally, a copy of the same list in the unallocated
      list also consumes O(n) space. Then the priority queue which manages the subsets requires O(k) space as it heavily
      dependent on the number of subsets. The space used by all other elements across the subset is O(n). All other
      variables can be ignored, which leads the space complexity to O(n) + O(n) + O(k). However since the space needed
      to store the elements of U is dominant, the complexity can be expressed as O(n).

  3b) Minimizing Subset Sum Differences with Standard Deviation Constraint

      ##TIME COMPLEXITY
      This is similar to 3a, but with an additional check for standard deviation. The GRASP complexity remains
      O(n log k), but the check for standard deviation adds an extra layer of complexity, as it involves calculating the
      standard deviation for each subset which basically can be expressed as O(mk) and can eventually be expressed as
      O(n), as m can be expressed as n/k. This layer makes the complexity O(n log k + n), but the GRASP complexity is
      still dominant and as such the complexity can be expressed as O(n log k) and based on the implementation in this
      code, the worst case is O(10,000 * n log k) because t = 10,000.

      ##SPACE COMPLEXITY
      The space complexity is very similar to 3a, as the inclusion of standard deviation calculations does not have any
      substantial effect to the space requirement. This makes the space complexity still O(n).

  3c) Minimizing Subset Sum Difference and maximising the number of relatively prime pair in each set

      ##TIME COMPLEXITY
      This is also similar to 3a, but with secondary objective of maximizing the number of relative prime pair in each
      set, This involves two major steps, the GRASP, and the process of counting relative prime pair for each subset.
      The complexity of GRASP remains the same. However, counting relative prime pairs for each subset can be expressed
      as O(m^2) because of the nested loop which checks each element in each subset. This can also be expressed as
      O((n/k)^2), which gives a quadratic and as such it cannot be simplified as O(n) and thus makes it somewhat complex,
      however the worst case complexity for this instance can definitely grow greater O(n log k) especially if the
      subsets have very large elements.

      ##SPACE COMPLEXITY
      The space complexity is also  similar to 3a, as the inclusion of relative prime pairs processing does not have any
      substantial effect to the space requirement as the process uses existing elements within subsets.
      This makes the space complexity still O(n).
